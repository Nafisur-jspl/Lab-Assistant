Suites are the best way to add your own, custom functions into the Assistant framework.

There are only a few requirements for suites to be imported and used-

1. "#suite.file" (without the quotes) must be the first line of code in your .py file (This feature will come later with an automatic search function)
2. There must be a method that is the same as the file name + "Method". (ie. DefaultSuite - def DefaultSuiteMethod())
3. When a command has been successfully heard based on the suite- the method MUST return True. If not, return false, so it will look for other commands from other suites.
4. All methods that use the Assistant class functions must pass the assistant as a parameter to the function, as well as the SuiteMethod() (For now)

To hook your method into the program, use the __main__.py included with the repository as an example. 

Add your suite to the sendCommands method in __main__.py similarly as DefaultSuiteMethod is used.

The following methods can be used in your custom Suites via the Assistant class:

Listen() - Starts the assistant- causes it to begin listening for it's name and exceuting voice commands based on imported suites or ChatBot
Speak(text) - "text" will be the value that your Assistant replies
playSound(audiofile) - "audiofile" being the .mp3 file to play located in the main directory (unless specified)

Other methods are currently internal, however there are variables that you can use to customize and read from your assistant:

Assistant.intent - Extracted intent from given command via Wit.Ai (in progress)
Assistant.userCommand - Raw command recognized by Google Speech (currently)
Assistant.name - TBA
Assistant.location - TBA
Assistant.voice - TBA
